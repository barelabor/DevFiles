Enforcement of the User Content or conduct rules set forth in this Agreement is solely at BareLabor's discretion, and failure to enforce such rules in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce such rules in other instances.

BareLabor Pic Your Price8.1 BareLabor Pic Your Price is a program in which you receive the following benefits: (a) detailed automotive repair service quotes from multiple local auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers (also referred to individually or collectively as “Shop(s)“); (b) information about the Shops including reviews from customers; (c) BareLabor's Service for the service(s) you purchased from the Shops booked through a quote from the Shops through BareLabor Pic Your Price on BareLabor; and (d) where applicable, customer discount offers.8.2 You agree to follow the following steps to obtain quotes from local Shops.8.3 Step 1: Where Will You be Coming from? Tell us your location by entering your street address, city, state, zip code, and please enter your e-mail address to receive an e-mail with your BareLabor Pic Your Price quote information.8.4 Step 2: What Vehicle Needs to be Serviced? Tell us about your vehicle by choosing from the drop down lists: the year your vehicle was made, the make, the model, the sub-model, and the engine size. (For example: Year = 2004, Make = Toyota, Model = Camry, Sub-model = LE, and Engine Size = 4 Cyl. 2.2L.) Not every vehicle ever made can be selected and therefore the BareLabor Pic Your Price service and BareLabor's Service is not available for every vehicle.8.5 Step 3: Do You Know What Service You Need? If you know what service needs to be done to your vehicle, choose the “Select a Service“ option. You will be shown a menu of available services. You can search for the service by category or type the part name in the search box and choose one of the matching presented menu items. Not every service available from a Shop is on the menu. If we do not have industry standard data for the service you select, we will display a message and you can pick another service from the menu. If you are unable to select a service BareLabor Pic Your Price will not be able to provide you with a quote.8.6 Once you select a service, BareLabor checks our database to see if we need more information in order to select the correct part for the service. If we do need more information, questions with answer options will be presented to you. Select the answer option(s) for your vehicle and selected repair service(s). Once all the questions are asked, you can choose either to add another service or the “Get Pic Your Price“ button.8.7 If you do not know what service needs to be done to your vehicle, select "Get a Diagnosis".8.8 Press the “Get Pic Your Price“ button and BareLabor starts generating quotes from local Shops.		These results are shown to you as we put them together.		BareLabor puts together all the pricing information from participating local Shops based upon the location you entered to generate a quote from each Shop.		All BareLabor's quotes are prepared using quality parts for your vehicle, industry standard labor times, and real-time pricing for parts and labor.		If the quote process does not find parts in inventory, prices for parts or participating shops that perform the selected service(s) for the selected vehicle, BareLabor will be unable to present quotes to you. Any shops BareLabor was unable to generate quotes for will be displayed as Trusted Local Shops, in which case you may call the Shop or BareLabor for pricing, but in which case you will not receive the BareLabor Service. If the quote process does not find a participating Shop that performs the selected service(s) for the selected vehicle, BareLabor will be unable to present quotes to you.		Since we cannot see your vehicle or inspect it through the Internet, and vehicles can be quite complicated to figure out problems and identify needed services, the quotes provided are for the service(s) you selected. Once you visit a Shop and the technician inspects your vehicle, it is possible that different or additional work and/or parts may be needed to repair your vehicle. This means the quote may change. The Shop may provide you with a new quote – or you can use BareLabor to generate a new quote for the recommended service(s). Remember, before any service is performed on your vehicle, you must provide your approval to the Shop. Please note that Shops reserve the right to refuse to perform the service(s) you selected using BareLabor Pic Your Price in which case you will not receive the BareLabor Service.		Some vehicles require extra labor time to service due to the severe condition of the vehicle. A severe service vehicle needing extra labor time shows advanced age, high mileage, lack of maintenance, abuse, or was used in a climate that promotes rust. After inspecting your vehicle, if the Shop determines the condition of your vehicle is severe, they may increase the labor price quoted.		You agree and understand that due to the complexity of auto repairs your vehicle may need repair services different than those submitted by you through BareLabor Pic Your Price, and therefore BareLabor and the Shop are under no obligation to honor any erroneously quoted BareLabor Pic Your Price. Further there may be pricing or calculation errors in your BareLabor Pic Your Price results and you agree that the Shop is not required to honor any such erroneous pricing or calculation errors in your BareLabor Pic Your Price. 8.9 Step 4: Make Appointment. After selecting the “Get Pic Your Price“ button you will be presented with quote results based upon the information you provided in the previous steps. In order to select a quote and make an appointment click the “Make Appointment“ button next to the selected quote. To create an account, enter a valid email address. This email address is the one you'll use to sign in to your account from now on. Enter a password. Enter the same password again to confirm it. Please enter your name and phone number (used to contact you about your appointment) and select a service date on the calendar and select a drop-off time and select “Make Appointment“. Please print your quote and provide it to the Shop. When and where applicable, in certain markets BareLabor may provide certain discount offers. After selecting “Make Appointment“ please print the provided Shop quote which includes any applicable discount offer and present this to the Shop.8.10 By using the BareLabor Pic Your Price service, you acknowledge that not all service shops are participating members and that participating Shops are not required to display signage that they are participating members. You further acknowledge that participation by one Shop in the BareLabor Pic Your Price program does not mean that another service shop with the same or similar name at a different location is participating in the BareLabor Pic Your Price and BareLabor Service program.8.11 Individuals under the age of 18 are not eligible to participate in the BareLabor Pic Your Price service.8.12 BareLabor is not responsible for a customer's inability to gain access to the Internet. BareLabor is not responsible for an inability to read the terms of any BareLabor promotion due to the fact that these terms are displayed in the English language. BareLabor shall not be liable for, and customer expressly waives any rights to, any consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages resulting from or caused by breach of this Agreement or any defective goods, materials, services, workmanship, products or supplies.8.13 BARELABOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE OR ALTER THE TERMS OF THE BARELABOR PIC YOUR PRICE SERVICE AT ANY TIME.9. BareLabor Pic Your Price Service9.1 BareLabor backs all the participating Shops in the BareLabor Pic Your Price program with the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service. That means if you are not satisfied with the service you received from the participating Shop you paid after booking an appointment at that Shop through the BareLabor Pic Your Price program on the BareLabor website and/or apps, we will be your advocate with the Shop to make things right - or we will pay to get your vehicle repaired elsewhere by having another Shop of BareLabor's choosing perform the service(s).9.2 To notify BareLabor of a claim under the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service, call BareLabor at 214-808-9615 and explain the situation to one of our customer service representatives. You will be asked to email or fax a copy of the receipt you received from the Shop. After gathering information from you about the situation, the customer service representative will submit a report to the BareLabor Resolution Team. A representative from this BareLabor Resolution Team will contact the Shop to gather more information and get back to you with a proposed resolution.9.3 BareLabor's goal is that the services performed by a Shop will be done right the first time. If the automotive repair or service was not performed to the customer's satisfaction and the customer notifies BareLabor within two weeks of the appointment date as confirmed through the BareLabor appointment process, then BareLabor commits to reasonably work with the customer and the original Shop until the customer is satisfied with the repair or services. In the event the customer is not satisfied with the repair or services performed by the original Shop then BareLabor commits to having the repair or service scheduled and performed again at another Shop of BareLabor's choosing at no additional charge to the customer.9.4 At all times BareLabor reserves the right to determine, using its own discretion, that it has reasonably responded to the customer to address the customer's dissatisfaction and nothing further can or will be done by BareLabor or at BareLabor's expense. At all times BareLabor reserves the right to limit the number of times and number of repair shops that a repair or service is performed under the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service.9.5 The BareLabor Pic Your Price Service only applies to normal use of the vehicle, when used and serviced in the manner provided and intended. BareLabor makes no other guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The BareLabor Pic Your Price Service is limited only to the original customer who was a party to the BareLabor Pic Your Price appointment and is non-transferable. The exclusive remedy of customer against BareLabor for breach of the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service shall be repair or replacement of the item(s) or part(s) as detailed on the original invoice from the Shop or repayment of the purchase price, at the option of BareLabor. The customer must present proof of the BareLabor Pic Your Price appointment and a copy of the invoice from the Shop which details the service(s) performed and the identity of the part(s) and part brand(s) installed in order for the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service to be valid. The BareLabor Pic Your Price Service does not apply to customer satisfaction issues first reported to BareLabor after the expiration of 14 days from the appointment date as reported through the BareLabor Pic Your Price process. BareLabor shall not be liable for, and customer expressly waives any rights to, any consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages resulting from or caused by any defective goods, materials, services, workmanship, products or supplies.9.6 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BARELABOR SERVICE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BARELABOR DOES NOT OTHERWISE WARRANT ANY REPAIRS OR SERVICES PERFORMED BY ANY SHOPS. BARELABOR DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY FOR ANY PARTS OR LABOR FOR ANY REPAIRS OR SERVICES PERFORMED BY ANY SHOPS.9.7 The Shops control the applicability and/or coverage of any warranty for the Shop's repairs, services, labor, or parts. BareLabor has no control over whether or not a Shop warrants its repairs, services, labor, or parts. Further, BareLabor has no control over whether or not a manufacturer warrants its parts.9.8 You acknowledge and agree that not all Shops warrant its services and repairs. Further, you acknowledge and agree that not all manufacturers warrant its parts. With the exception of any claims made pursuant to the BareLabor Service you acknowledge and agree that you will not make a warranty claim to BareLabor for any repair or service performed by a Shop and, if you do, BareLabor has the automatic right to deny such a warranty claim that is not made in compliance with the terms of the BareLabor Service.10. Proprietary rights10.1 You acknowledge and agree that BareLabor (or BareLabor’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including Content, and any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by BareLabor and that you shall not disclose such information without BareLabor’s prior written consent.10.2 Nothing in this Agreement gives you a right to use any of BareLabor's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.10.3 Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, BareLabor acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with BareLabor, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that BareLabor has no obligation to do so on your behalf.10.4 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.10.5 You agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.11. Content license from you11.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying the content on BareLabor you give BareLabor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling BareLabor to display, distribute and promote the Services.11.2 You agree that this license includes a right for BareLabor to make such content available to other companies, organizations or individuals with whom BareLabor has relationships for the provision of syndicated services, and to use such content in connection with the provision of those services.11.3 You understand that BareLabor, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users, may (a) transmit or distribute your content over various public networks and in various media; and (b) make such changes to your content as are necessary to conform and adapt that content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media. You agree that this license shall permit BareLabor to take these actions.11.4 You confirm and warrant to BareLabor that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the above license.12. Termination by BareLabor12.1 BareLabor may at any time, terminate its legal Agreement with you for any reason, at BareLabor’s sole discretion, including, but not limited to the following:		(A) you have breached any provision of this Agreement (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of this Agreement); or		(B) BareLabor is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or		(C) the partner with whom BareLabor offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with BareLabor or ceased to offer the Services to you; or		(D) BareLabor is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to areas where you are a resident or from which you use the service; or		(E) the provision of the Services to you by BareLabor is, in BareLabor’s opinion, no longer commercially viable.12.2 Nothing in this Section shall affect BareLabor’s rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of this Agreement.13. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES13.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”13.2 IN PARTICULAR, BARELABOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT:(A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,(B) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR,(C) ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, AND(D) THAT DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.13.3 ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.13.4 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BARELABOR OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.13.5 BARELABOR FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.13.6 While BareLabor endeavors to provide useful Services, including allowing users and third parties to provide useful information and services regarding and relating to auto repair and maintenance, auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers, you acknowledge that such information is reliant upon third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that such information may be incomplete or may contain inaccuracies (including without limitation any interpretations and reviews of such Services) and that all circumstances are unique and the Services may not be appropriate for your circumstances or may be outdated or contain errors, omissions or misinterpretations of information.13.7 You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to conduct an independent evaluation and otherwise verify the accuracy, suitability, and applicability of the Services for your situation, circumstances and purposes before relying or acting upon such Services. You further acknowledge that an BareLabor Rating, BareLabor Review, and/or Yelp™ review, and the other information contained in an auto repair professionals', auto repair shops' (and/or a Shop’s) and auto repair service providers' profile on BareLabor Pic Your Price, such as descriptions of areas of specialization on a repair or service quote, and other data, summaries or descriptions, are based on the data obtained by or submitted to BareLabor, which may be incomplete or inaccurate, and rely on automated interpretations of the information gathered by or submitted to BareLabor. An BareLabor Rating, BareLabor Review, and/or Yelp™ review does NOT reflect BareLabor's assessment of a given auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider. Rather, such ratings are an aggregation of reviews and/or ratings based upon many factors, including the information submitted by users to BareLabor. Consequently, someone else's assessment of the same auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider may be different or based upon different information. Neither BareLabor Ratings, BareLabor Review, and/or Yelp™ review nor any of the other information provided through the Services, are an endorsement of any particular auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider or are a guarantee of an auto repair professionals', auto repair shops' and auto repair service providers' quality, competency, qualifications, experience, resources, character, honesty, integrity, responsiveness or other personal and professional characteristics. Nor are they a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such an auto repair professional, auto repair shop and auto repair service provider is involved. The information provided on the BareLabor Web site is intended to be a starting point to gather information about auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers who may be suitable for your automotive parts, repair and maintenance needs, but you should not rely solely on such information in deciding whether to hire any given auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider. Furthermore, you should independently verify the accuracy of any information you obtain from the Services before using it, and you should obtain independent references for any auto repair professionals, auto repair shops or auto repair service providers you are considering hiring. You agree to be solely responsible for your use of the Services and for determining the suitability of, and the results obtained from, any auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers you hire.13.8 Additional information about the Services, including without limitation, the BareLabor Rating, BareLabor Review, BareLabor Pic Your Price, BareLabor Customer Support, BareLabor Repair Answers, BareLabor How-to-Guides or How-to-Videos, the sources of information displayed on the BareLabor Web site, and other important matters is contained within the BareLabor Web site itself, and you acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services, is informed by and subject not only to these Terms but also by the information and explanation(s) available on these pages.13.9 BARELABOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS CONTAINED ON THE SITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION USER CONTENT, AUTO PARTS, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE INFORMATION, VEHICLE RECALLS AND TSBS, PRICING AND RELATED INFORMATION ON BARELABOR PIC YOUR PRICE AND/OR BARELABOR ESTIMATES, AUTO REPAIR SHOP PROFILE INFORMATION OR AUTO REPAIR SHOP INFORMATION, SITE MATERIALS, THE SERVICES, THE BARELABOR RATING, THE BARELABOR REVIEWS, YELP™ REVIEWS, BARELABOR REPAIR ANSWERS, BARELABOR HOW-TO-GUIDES OR HOW-TO-VIDEOS, OR THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION DISPLAYED ON THE SITE.

(For example: Year = 2004, Make = Toyota, Model = Camry, Sub-model = LE, and Engine Size = 4 Cyl. 2.2L.)

If we do not have industry standard data for the service you select, we will display a message and you can pick another service from the menu. If you are unable to select a service BareLabor Pic Your Price will not be able to provide you with a quote.8.6 Once you select a service, BareLabor checks our database to see if we need more information in order to select the correct part for the service. If we do need more information, questions with answer options will be presented to you. Select the answer option(s) for your vehicle and selected repair service(s). Once all the questions are asked, you can choose either to add another service or the “Get Pic Your Price“ button.8.7 If you do not know what service needs to be done to your vehicle, select "Get a Diagnosis".8.8 Press the “Get Pic Your Price“ button and BareLabor starts generating quotes from local Shops.		These results are shown to you as we put them together.		BareLabor puts together all the pricing information from participating local Shops based upon the location you entered to generate a quote from each Shop.		All BareLabor's quotes are prepared using quality parts for your vehicle, industry standard labor times, and real-time pricing for parts and labor.		If the quote process does not find parts in inventory, prices for parts or participating shops that perform the selected service(s) for the selected vehicle, BareLabor will be unable to present quotes to you. Any shops BareLabor was unable to generate quotes for will be displayed as Trusted Local Shops, in which case you may call the Shop or BareLabor for pricing, but in which case you will not receive the BareLabor Service. If the quote process does not find a participating Shop that performs the selected service(s) for the selected vehicle, BareLabor will be unable to present quotes to you.		Since we cannot see your vehicle or inspect it through the Internet, and vehicles can be quite complicated to figure out problems and identify needed services, the quotes provided are for the service(s) you selected. Once you visit a Shop and the technician inspects your vehicle, it is possible that different or additional work and/or parts may be needed to repair your vehicle. This means the quote may change. The Shop may provide you with a new quote – or you can use BareLabor to generate a new quote for the recommended service(s). Remember, before any service is performed on your vehicle, you must provide your approval to the Shop. Please note that Shops reserve the right to refuse to perform the service(s) you selected using BareLabor Pic Your Price in which case you will not receive the BareLabor Service.		Some vehicles require extra labor time to service due to the severe condition of the vehicle. A severe service vehicle needing extra labor time shows advanced age, high mileage, lack of maintenance, abuse, or was used in a climate that promotes rust. After inspecting your vehicle, if the Shop determines the condition of your vehicle is severe, they may increase the labor price quoted.		You agree and understand that due to the complexity of auto repairs your vehicle may need repair services different than those submitted by you through BareLabor Pic Your Price, and therefore BareLabor and the Shop are under no obligation to honor any erroneously quoted BareLabor Pic Your Price. Further there may be pricing or calculation errors in your BareLabor Pic Your Price results and you agree that the Shop is not required to honor any such erroneous pricing or calculation errors in your BareLabor Pic Your Price. 8.9 Step 4: Make Appointment. After selecting the “Get Pic Your Price“ button you will be presented with quote results based upon the information you provided in the previous steps. In order to select a quote and make an appointment click the “Make Appointment“ button next to the selected quote. To create an account, enter a valid email address. This email address is the one you'll use to sign in to your account from now on. Enter a password. Enter the same password again to confirm it. Please enter your name and phone number (used to contact you about your appointment) and select a service date on the calendar and select a drop-off time and select “Make Appointment“. Please print your quote and provide it to the Shop. When and where applicable, in certain markets BareLabor may provide certain discount offers. After selecting “Make Appointment“ please print the provided Shop quote which includes any applicable discount offer and present this to the Shop.8.10 By using the BareLabor Pic Your Price service, you acknowledge that not all service shops are participating members and that participating Shops are not required to display signage that they are participating members. You further acknowledge that participation by one Shop in the BareLabor Pic Your Price program does not mean that another service shop with the same or similar name at a different location is participating in the BareLabor Pic Your Price and BareLabor Service program.8.11 Individuals under the age of 18 are not eligible to participate in the BareLabor Pic Your Price service.8.12 BareLabor is not responsible for a customer's inability to gain access to the Internet. BareLabor is not responsible for an inability to read the terms of any BareLabor promotion due to the fact that these terms are displayed in the English language. BareLabor shall not be liable for, and customer expressly waives any rights to, any consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages resulting from or caused by breach of this Agreement or any defective goods, materials, services, workmanship, products or supplies.8.13 BARELABOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE OR ALTER THE TERMS OF THE BARELABOR PIC YOUR PRICE SERVICE AT ANY TIME.9. BareLabor Pic Your Price Service9.1 BareLabor backs all the participating Shops in the BareLabor Pic Your Price program with the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service. That means if you are not satisfied with the service you received from the participating Shop you paid after booking an appointment at that Shop through the BareLabor Pic Your Price program on the BareLabor website and/or apps, we will be your advocate with the Shop to make things right - or we will pay to get your vehicle repaired elsewhere by having another Shop of BareLabor's choosing perform the service(s).9.2 To notify BareLabor of a claim under the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service, call BareLabor at 214-808-9615 and explain the situation to one of our customer service representatives. You will be asked to email or fax a copy of the receipt you received from the Shop. After gathering information from you about the situation, the customer service representative will submit a report to the BareLabor Resolution Team. A representative from this BareLabor Resolution Team will contact the Shop to gather more information and get back to you with a proposed resolution.9.3 BareLabor's goal is that the services performed by a Shop will be done right the first time. If the automotive repair or service was not performed to the customer's satisfaction and the customer notifies BareLabor within two weeks of the appointment date as confirmed through the BareLabor appointment process, then BareLabor commits to reasonably work with the customer and the original Shop until the customer is satisfied with the repair or services. In the event the customer is not satisfied with the repair or services performed by the original Shop then BareLabor commits to having the repair or service scheduled and performed again at another Shop of BareLabor's choosing at no additional charge to the customer.9.4 At all times BareLabor reserves the right to determine, using its own discretion, that it has reasonably responded to the customer to address the customer's dissatisfaction and nothing further can or will be done by BareLabor or at BareLabor's expense. At all times BareLabor reserves the right to limit the number of times and number of repair shops that a repair or service is performed under the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service.9.5 The BareLabor Pic Your Price Service only applies to normal use of the vehicle, when used and serviced in the manner provided and intended. BareLabor makes no other guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The BareLabor Pic Your Price Service is limited only to the original customer who was a party to the BareLabor Pic Your Price appointment and is non-transferable. The exclusive remedy of customer against BareLabor for breach of the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service shall be repair or replacement of the item(s) or part(s) as detailed on the original invoice from the Shop or repayment of the purchase price, at the option of BareLabor. The customer must present proof of the BareLabor Pic Your Price appointment and a copy of the invoice from the Shop which details the service(s) performed and the identity of the part(s) and part brand(s) installed in order for the BareLabor Pic Your Price Service to be valid. The BareLabor Pic Your Price Service does not apply to customer satisfaction issues first reported to BareLabor after the expiration of 14 days from the appointment date as reported through the BareLabor Pic Your Price process. BareLabor shall not be liable for, and customer expressly waives any rights to, any consequential, special, incidental or punitive damages resulting from or caused by any defective goods, materials, services, workmanship, products or supplies.9.6 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BARELABOR SERVICE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BARELABOR DOES NOT OTHERWISE WARRANT ANY REPAIRS OR SERVICES PERFORMED BY ANY SHOPS. BARELABOR DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY FOR ANY PARTS OR LABOR FOR ANY REPAIRS OR SERVICES PERFORMED BY ANY SHOPS.9.7 The Shops control the applicability and/or coverage of any warranty for the Shop's repairs, services, labor, or parts. BareLabor has no control over whether or not a Shop warrants its repairs, services, labor, or parts. Further, BareLabor has no control over whether or not a manufacturer warrants its parts.9.8 You acknowledge and agree that not all Shops warrant its services and repairs. Further, you acknowledge and agree that not all manufacturers warrant its parts. With the exception of any claims made pursuant to the BareLabor Service you acknowledge and agree that you will not make a warranty claim to BareLabor for any repair or service performed by a Shop and, if you do, BareLabor has the automatic right to deny such a warranty claim that is not made in compliance with the terms of the BareLabor Service.10. Proprietary rights10.1 You acknowledge and agree that BareLabor (or BareLabor’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including Content, and any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You further acknowledge that the Services may contain information which is designated confidential by BareLabor and that you shall not disclose such information without BareLabor’s prior written consent.10.2 Nothing in this Agreement gives you a right to use any of BareLabor's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.10.3 Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, BareLabor acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with BareLabor, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that BareLabor has no obligation to do so on your behalf.10.4 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.10.5 You agree that in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.11.

You agree that this license shall permit BareLabor to take these actions.11.4 You confirm and warrant to BareLabor that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the above license.12. Termination by BareLabor12.1 BareLabor may at any time, terminate its legal Agreement with you for any reason, at BareLabor’s sole discretion, including, but not limited to the following:		(A) you have breached any provision of this Agreement (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of this Agreement); or		(B) BareLabor is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or		(C) the partner with whom BareLabor offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with BareLabor or ceased to offer the Services to you; or		(D) BareLabor is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to areas where you are a resident or from which you use the service; or		(E) the provision of the Services to you by BareLabor is, in BareLabor’s opinion, no longer commercially viable.12.2 Nothing in this Section shall affect BareLabor’s rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of this Agreement.13. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES13.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”13.2 IN PARTICULAR, BARELABOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT:(A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,(B) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR,(C) ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, AND(D) THAT DEFECTS IN THE OPERATION OR FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.13.3 ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.13.4 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BARELABOR OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.13.5 BARELABOR FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.13.6 While BareLabor endeavors to provide useful Services, including allowing users and third parties to provide useful information and services regarding and relating to auto repair and maintenance, auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers, you acknowledge that such information is reliant upon third party data and contributions, that there are certain inherent limitations to the accuracy or currency of such information, that such information may be incomplete or may contain inaccuracies (including without limitation any interpretations and reviews of such Services) and that all circumstances are unique and the Services may not be appropriate for your circumstances or may be outdated or contain errors, omissions or misinterpretations of information.13.7 You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to conduct an independent evaluation and otherwise verify the accuracy, suitability, and applicability of the Services for your situation, circumstances and purposes before relying or acting upon such Services. You further acknowledge that an BareLabor Rating, BareLabor Review, and/or Yelp™ review, and the other information contained in an auto repair professionals', auto repair shops' (and/or a Shop’s) and auto repair service providers' profile on BareLabor Pic Your Price, such as descriptions of areas of specialization on a repair or service quote, and other data, summaries or descriptions, are based on the data obtained by or submitted to BareLabor, which may be incomplete or inaccurate, and rely on automated interpretations of the information gathered by or submitted to BareLabor. An BareLabor Rating, BareLabor Review, and/or Yelp™ review does NOT reflect BareLabor's assessment of a given auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider. Rather, such ratings are an aggregation of reviews and/or ratings based upon many factors, including the information submitted by users to BareLabor. Consequently, someone else's assessment of the same auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider may be different or based upon different information. Neither BareLabor Ratings, BareLabor Review, and/or Yelp™ review nor any of the other information provided through the Services, are an endorsement of any particular auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider or are a guarantee of an auto repair professionals', auto repair shops' and auto repair service providers' quality, competency, qualifications, experience, resources, character, honesty, integrity, responsiveness or other personal and professional characteristics. Nor are they a predictor of the outcome of any matter in which such an auto repair professional, auto repair shop and auto repair service provider is involved. The information provided on the BareLabor Web site is intended to be a starting point to gather information about auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers who may be suitable for your automotive parts, repair and maintenance needs, but you should not rely solely on such information in deciding whether to hire any given auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider. Furthermore, you should independently verify the accuracy of any information you obtain from the Services before using it, and you should obtain independent references for any auto repair professionals, auto repair shops or auto repair service providers you are considering hiring. You agree to be solely responsible for your use of the Services and for determining the suitability of, and the results obtained from, any auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers you hire.13.8 Additional information about the Services, including without limitation, the BareLabor Rating, BareLabor Review, BareLabor Pic Your Price, BareLabor Customer Support, BareLabor Repair Answers, BareLabor How-to-Guides or How-to-Videos, the sources of information displayed on the BareLabor Web site, and other important matters is contained within the BareLabor Web site itself, and you acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services, is informed by and subject not only to these Terms but also by the information and explanation(s) available on these pages.13.9 BARELABOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS CONTAINED ON THE SITE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION USER CONTENT, AUTO PARTS, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE INFORMATION, VEHICLE RECALLS AND TSBS, PRICING AND RELATED INFORMATION ON BARELABOR PIC YOUR PRICE AND/OR BARELABOR ESTIMATES, AUTO REPAIR SHOP PROFILE INFORMATION OR AUTO REPAIR SHOP INFORMATION, SITE MATERIALS, THE SERVICES, THE BARELABOR RATING, THE BARELABOR REVIEWS, YELP™ REVIEWS, BARELABOR REPAIR ANSWERS, BARELABOR HOW-TO-GUIDES OR HOW-TO-VIDEOS, OR THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION DISPLAYED ON THE SITE.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.(D) YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BARELABOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE DEFAMATORY OR OFFENSIVE CONTENT OR DANGEROUS OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND THAT THE RISK OF HARM OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.(E) THESE EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

NEITHER YOU NOR BARELABOR WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable in a particular case, then this arbitration agreement shall be null and void in that case. This Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and, where consistent, California law. Notwithstanding this, you agree that BareLabor shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. BareLabor reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes filed before the effective date of the amendment. This provision will survive the termination of your right to use the Services.17.
